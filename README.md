Hi! I'm a Computer Science and Physics student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and I enjoy implementing data collection and analysis techniquies in support of real-world applications. Here you'll find some of the projects that I'm either currently working on or have worked on in the past.

# [Stock Analysis Application](https://coltonglasgow13.github.io/goose-stock "goose-stock") (work in progress)

# [Data-Driven Collectible Resale Business](https://coltonglasgow13.github.io/mtg_goose "mtg-goose") (ended Feb 2021)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous project collected limited amounts of data about collectible card prices, but I wanted a system that would provide all the data I could want in terms of investment and resale decisions. Therefore, I developed an application to scrape data from a variety of sources and store it in a remotely hosted relational database, where I then used it for analysis and visualization. Through the support of this application, I have been able to sustain my collectible resale business (Household Gaming) for years by making data-driven decisions and building my understanding of the market from the bottom up.

# [Collectible Card Data Automation](https://coltonglasgow13.github.io/mtg-python-public "mtg-python-public") (ended May 2020)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectible card games such as Magic the Gathering or the Pokemon Trading Card Game have been a longtime hobby of mine, but they were very expensive as a kid with no income. Therefore, I developed a basic application integrating Python's data collection and visualization and Google Sheets' data storage to track the prices of cards I was interested in and notify me when they passed certain thresholds.

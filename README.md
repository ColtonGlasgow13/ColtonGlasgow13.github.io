Here you'll find some of the projects that I'm either currently working on or have worked on in the past.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ColtonGlasgow13/ColtonGlasgow13.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
